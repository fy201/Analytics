This project contains working scripts for running numerical analyses.

Three analytics methods are implemented:
 - Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), including several kernels (`kde.js`)
 - Linear Regression (`linreg.js`)
 - k-means clustering (`kmeans.js`)

`main.js` shows basic application of these methods on the faithful dataset (waiting time and duration of eruption for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park).

Inspired by M. Bostock's examples: https://observablehq.com/@d3/kernel-density-estimation; https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/linear-regression.
